## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Fun little project that was a good introduction to working with APIs

## Optimizations

Was able to hack together some code that worked but I wasn't happy with it's spaghetti-ness. Refactored the JavaScript to make it much more readable and optimal by getting rid of global variables and making reusable functions.

## Lessons Learned:

My first foray into asynchronous JavaScript and utilizing APIs. I can definitely see how necessary these things will be in in my future coding career.
